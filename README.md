nicepls uses [alexjs](https://github.com/wooorm/alex) to
detect insensitive words, explain
the error and suggest possible alternatives.

Motivation

This app is meant for those who would love to use alexjs features but does not have access
to node or any editor that currently has alexjs integration and found the online demo not suitable for long-term use.
The interface mimics the original alexjs [online demo](http://alexjs.com/#demo).
