nicepls uses [alexjs](https://github.com/wooorm/alex) to
detect insensitive words, explain
the error and suggest possible alternatives.

Motivation
---
This app is meant those who would like to use alexjs features but does not have access
to node or any editor that currently has alexjs integration and found the online demo impractical for long-term use.
The interface mimics the original alexjs [online demo](http://alexjs.com/#demo).
